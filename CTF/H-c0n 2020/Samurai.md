Once downloaded the image "samurai.png", looks like this:

One of the first steps that I always do with stego challenges, is check the file properties and metadata:

With command **file** I didn't see anything out of the expected, so I continue with **exiftool**

The first impression was something weird with the name of the author, however, I keep digging with **binwalk**

Here I found something useful, a zip compressed inside the png. Binwalk has an option to extract the compressed files

Nice! We found a **wav** file. Next step, open the file with a [Spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). There is a GUI tool called [Sonic Visualizer](https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/). 

Once opened, I've saw the word üê±‚Äçüë§ **SHINOBI** üê±‚Äçüë§

After try to use **SHINOBI** as a password with different stego programs, finally I tried with [stegpy](https://github.com/dhsdshdhk/stegpy) and it worked:

The funny thing here is the name of the author of the image **png**, since it is the username of the repository of the tool to extract the secret, but I didn't realize until I found the repository manually instead of search for the name of the author from the beginning.
