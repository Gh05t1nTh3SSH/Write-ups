Once downloaded the image "samurai.png" we opened and it look like this:

One of the first steps that I always do with stego challenges, is check the file properties and metadata:

With **file** command I didn't see anything out of the expected, so I keep digging with **exiftool**

The first impresion was the name of the autor, however, I keep with my checklist with **binwalk**

Here I found something useful, a zip compressed inside the png. Binwalk has an option to extract the compressed files
