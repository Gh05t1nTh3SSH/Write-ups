Once downloaded the image "samurai.png", looks like this:

One of the first steps that I always do with stego challenges, is check the file properties and metadata:

With command **file** I didn't see anything out of the expected, so I continue with **exiftool**

The first impresion was something weird with the name of the author, however, I keep digging with **binwalk**

Here I found something useful, a zip compressed inside the png. Binwalk has an option to extract the compressed files

Nice! We found a **wav** file. After checking the metadata and properties, I've opened the file with an [Spectrogram].

There is a GUI tool called [Sonic Visualizer]. With the option (P), we can open the Spectrogram and see the word **SHINOBI**

After try to use **SHINOBI** as a password with different stego programs, finally I tried with [stegpy] and it worked:
